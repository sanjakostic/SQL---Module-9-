# SQL---Module-9-
---
Starting with the ERD, I used it as a reference in creating the CREATE TABLE statements, starting with the tables didn't have incoming dependencies (had no foreign keys), and then continuing with the rest of the tables. I set all columns aside from PRIMARY KEYS as NOT NULL because I didn't want to include null data (if there was any). 
The  queries offer insights into the employee database. For the last question that asked for employee last name frequencies in descending order, I included the last name because I wasn't sure whether or not the last name itself was intended or not.
